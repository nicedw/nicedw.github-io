        <h1> Auckland's History </h1>
        <p>The human history of the Auckland metropolitan area stretches from early Māori settlers in the 14th century to the first European explorers in the late 18th century, over a short stretch as the official capital of (European-settled) New Zealand in the middle of the 19th century to its current position as the fastest-growing and commercially dominating metropolis of the country. </p>

          <h1> Maori History </h1>
          <p> Tāmaki Makau Rau ('Isthmus of one thousand lovers', also translated as 'Tamaki-the bride sought by a hundred suitors'), now known as Auckland, was first settled by Māori people around 1350. <br><br> The narrow Auckland isthmus was a strategic location with its two harbours providing access to the sea on both the west and east coasts. It also had fertile soils which facilitated horticulture and the two harbours provided plentiful kai moana (seafood). Māori constructed terraced pā (fortified villages) on the volcanic peaks.<br><br> The Māori population in the region is estimated to have peaked at 20,000 in pre-European settlement times. Earthworks are still evident today around some of the larger volcanoes such as Mount Albert, Maungawhau and Maungakiekie.</p>

          <h1> European Settlement </h1>
          <p> Ngāti Whātua and Tainui were the main tribes living in the area when Europeans arrived, having captured it by conquest several generations previously. The arrival of Europeans in New Zealand changed the balance of power between iwi, as European settlement to the north enabled traditional rivals Ngāpuhi and allied northern iwi to acquire muskets by trade. Initially no military advantage accrued; despite lacking muskets, Ngāti Whātua defeated musket-equipped Ngāpuhi in the battle of Moremonui, killing 2,000.<br><br>Europeans also brought new diseases (notably smallpox and tuberculosis) which, as elsewhere, lead to significant mortality and morbidity amongst immunologically naive Māori. The result was the Auckland isthmus remained a virtually vacated buffer zone between iwi, with a population probably under 500 in 1840.</p>
